  How it affects the world
  {
    Data espionage is increasingly threatening individuals' privacy, as sensitive personal information is stolen or exploited for financial gain, identity theft,or manipulation.
    On a larger scale, itâ€™s shaping geopolitics by fueling tensions between nations, with cyberattacks and data breaches becoming tools for espionage and strategic advantage.
    As countries vie for control over data and technology, this digital warfare complicates international relations and raises concerns about global security, privacy, and trust.
